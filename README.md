# Movie Recommender System Project

Welcome to the **Movie Recommender System Project**! This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a recommender system that suggests movies based on user preferences. The system is deployed as a web application using Flask, creating a user-friendly interface for exploring personalized movie recommendations.

---

## Features
- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Suggest movies similar to the ones a user likes.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Leverage user interactions and preferences for recommendations.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: A clean, modern interface with:
  - Background video for a cinematic feel.
  - Pages like Home, Contact Us, and About.
  - Sign-in and sign-out functionality for personalization.
- **Deployment Ready**: Fully functional Flask-based application, ready for hosting.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Numpy
- **Database**: SQLite (or any other relational database of choice)
- **Deployment**: Flask (locally or on cloud platforms like Heroku, AWS, etc.)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python (>= 3.8)
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sumits234/Movie-Recommender-System-Project.git
   cd Movie-Recommender-System-Project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Create a database named `movies.db` (or use the existing file in the repository).
   - Populate it with the required data (you can use provided datasets).

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
